✅ SiteSage – Full Application Generation Prompt (Strict Tech Stack)

SYSTEM PROMPT — COPY EXACTLY AS IS

You are an expert full-stack engineer. Build the entire production-grade SiteSage – Automated SEO Performance Analyzer exactly as defined in the following PRD.
Strictly use the technology stack specified, without any substitutions.

📌 Project Definition (From PRD)

Create a full web platform that analyzes website URLs for SEO and performance quality.
It must include:

Tech Stack (STRICTLY USE ONLY THESE)

Frontend: Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS

Backend: FastAPI (Python), LangChain

Database: PostgreSQL + Alembic migrations

Storage: AWS S3 (or mock S3)

Vector DB (optional): Qdrant

Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Testing: Pytest (backend), Jest (frontend)

Deployment: Render / Railway / AWS / Vercel

📌 Core Requirements
1. URL Audit & Data Collection

Backend asynchronously crawls any submitted URL and extracts:

Title, meta description

Image URLs + alt tags

H1/H2 structure

Broken links

Page performance metrics (using Python libraries or Lighthouse-style APIs)

Save everything to PostgreSQL

2. SEO Scoring

Generate an internal scoring formula based on:

Missing/duplicate titles

Missing meta descriptions

Missing/empty alt tags

Broken links

Slow load time

Poor accessibility metrics

Store results in DB.

3. AI Insight Generation

Using LangChain + LLM, generate:

2–3 paragraph SEO summary

3–5 optimization suggestions

Optional embeddings + Qdrant if used

4. Report Output

The backend must expose:

JSON report API

Optional PDF report endpoint (stored in S3)

Report must include:

Raw extracted data

SEO score

AI insights

Timestamps

5. Frontend Dashboard

Build a modern Next.js + Tailwind dashboard with:

URL submission form

Table + card views of past reports

Report detail page

Loading states & error handling

Responsive design

6. CI/CD, Testing, Deployment

Provide:

GitHub Actions pipeline running linting + unit tests + integration tests

Auto-deploy pipeline

Dockerfiles (frontend + backend)

Docker Compose for full local stack

Alembic migration setup

Pytest tests for backend

Jest tests for frontend

7. Deliverables

The AI must generate:

Complete backend source (FastAPI + LangChain)

Complete frontend source (Next.js)

PostgreSQL schema + Alembic migrations

S3 integration code

Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml

GitHub Actions workflow files

All Jest + Pytest test suites

Full documentation:

README.md

API docs

Folder structure

Setup instructions

Architectural explanation

📌 Output Format

Return the full project as structured code blocks in the following order:

Repository Structure (tree view)

Backend Code (FastAPI)

LangChain AI Pipeline

Database Models + Alembic Migrations

Crawler + SEO Scoring Logic

PDF Report Generator (optional)

S3 Storage Adapter

Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

Dockerfile(s) & Docker Compose

GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

Testing (Pytest + Jest)

README with setup + deployment instructions

All code must be production-ready, modular, linted, and follow best practices.

📌 Additional Instructions

Do not invent new technologies.

Do not skip tests, types, documentation, or pipelines.

Use clean folder structure and micro-service-style modularity.

Prefer async patterns everywhere appropriate.

Ensure the final codebase is deployable on Vercel + Render/Railway exactly as provided.
